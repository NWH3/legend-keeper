Here Ambria was built, next to the Barbarian settlements that were scattered throughout the Davokar forest. Rejected by all who claim Davokar their home, the Ambrians are seen as intruders to the land by both the Elder Folks and the local Barbarians. With the threat of the Dark Lords and their hordes of corrupted undead, diplomacy and peace between the living races is the needed path for all civilizations inhabiting the land to survive.

Desperate for any of the secrets kept deep within the Davokar forests that might help return the Dark Lords to their slumber, Queen Korintha sends expedition after expedition into Davokar in hopes of finding their salvation. It is south of the Titans mountains that we start our journey, in the once beautiful lands of Alberetor. Two decades after Queen Korintha had been freed from the Dark Lords grasp.

Forever changed by the madness.\n- Having escaped the sea creature's grasp, the group hiked through the thick forest of Davokar until they find the Earth Towers themselves.\n- Before exploration of the towers could happen, a Treasure Hunting troll by the name of Rityr comes running out of the closest earth tower mound followed by undead.\n- After fighting off the majority of undead the group helps and questions Rityr who agrees to help where he can.\n- Rityr explains that he was searching for Troll artifacts in the Earth Towers to reclaim for his people.
