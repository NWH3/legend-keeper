      "desc": "Intro: And so Albertor fell, forcing Queen Korintha and her people north over the Titans mountains to Davokar's edge. Here Ambria was built, next to the Barbarian settlements that were scattered throughout the Davokar forest. Rejected by all who claim Davokar their home, the Ambrians are seen as intruders to the land by both the Elder Folks and the local Barbarians. With the threat of the Dark Lords and their hordes of corrupted undead, diplomacy and peace between the living races is the needed path for all civilizations inhabiting the land to survive. Unable to return home or rid the land of the corruption, Queen Korintha gathers her strength and seeks new options to help her people and power grow. Symbaroum, an ancient civilization which once spanned all the realm, now lays in ruin as nature and the corruption slowly take hold. Desperate for any of the secrets kept deep within the Davokar forests that might help return the Dark Lords to their slumber, Queen Korintha sends expedition after expedition into Davokar in hopes of finding their salvation. It is south of the Titans mountains that we start our journey, in the once beautiful lands of Alberetor. Two decades after Queen Korintha had been freed from the Dark Lords grasp.

      "desc": "Intro: News of the Flayer's capture has spread quickly through Thistle Hold providing a great deal of peace to the people. However, rumors of blighted beasts attacking in packs, dead rising from their graves, and wild monsters tracking any trespassing Treasure Hunters still fill Ambria. The most notable story, which is known by near any Thistle Hold Treasure Hunter or southern Davokar Barbarian, is the legend of The Wild Hunt. Though many have conflicting details, all seem to agree on a few key points. The giant sow, who is reported to stand near 18 foot tall, has been targeted by the Eternal Hunter, a winter elf of great skill and unknown origins. Some say the hunter has been here when Symbaroum was whole and spanned the entire realm. At the request of both Mayor Nightpitch and Grand Master Ira of Ordo Magica, you have been asked to investigate the ruins of the fallen Symbar Hurian Lo Apak, where the Copper Crown was originally taken from by Gorak and Alahara.
